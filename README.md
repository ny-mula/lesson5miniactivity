 <h1>All about Denzel</h1>  

   <p> a 28-year-old aspiring baker hailing from Seattle.“Denzel discovered his love for baking at the tender age of 10 when he baked his first batch of chocolate chip
    cookies with his grandmother. The joy of creating something delicious from scratch enthralled him. Over the years,
    he honed his skills by experimenting with various recipes and even creating some of his own. His dream is to share
     the joy of baking with others and inspire them to create their own baked wonders.” </p>  
<h2>Three of his recipes</h2>

 <li>Almond Croissants: A delicate pastry filled with the sweet nutty goodness of almond paste, dusted with powdered sugar, and baked to a golden perfection
    Ingredients: 1 sheet of puff pastry, 1/2 cup of almond paste, 1/4 cup of powdered sugar, 1 egg (for egg wash). Instructions: First, preheat the oven to 375°F. Next, roll out the puff pastry and cut it into triangles. Spread a thin layer of almond

  <li> Sourdough Bread: A community favorite, boasting a crusty exterior and a soft, airy interior, embodying the classic
  sourdough charm
  Ingredients: 1 cup sourdough starter, 1 1/2 cups warm water, 4 cups bread flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt.
  Instructions:
  First, mix the starter, water, and 3 cups of flour in a large bowl. This should create a sticky dough. Next, add salt,
  and remaining flour 1 tablespoon at a time until they are fully incorporated. Then, knead the dough on a floured
  surface for about 15 minutes. Once the kneading is done, place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover it, and
  let it rise for about 5 hours. Finally, shape the dough into a loaf, and let it rest for 30 minutes. When you are ready
  to bake, preheat your oven to 450°F and bake for about 30 minutes until it's golden brown.</li>

  <h3> Story behhind the carrot cake </h3>
  
  <p>  An homage to tradition and familial bonds, enriched with the natural sweetness of carrots
    and a crunch of walnuts, it holds a special place in his heart as it was his late grandfather's favorite. Every year on
    his grandfather's birthday, Denzel bakes this cake to honor his memory and the bond they shared over the love of
    baking. </p>
